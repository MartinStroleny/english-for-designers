# Afterlife
To present the project, I created several of the following slides, which as a whole form pitchdeck. I also use similar slides in my bachelor thesis.

## Introduction
![slide 1 introduction](img/slide-1.png)
The first introductory slide presents the title and one of the key claims of Afterlife. I have been communicating from the very beginning that the service focuses on both designers and people who consume fashion or buy and resell it.

The second slide describes the 3 key issues that give rise to this service.

The third slide responds to the identified problems and communicates their solutions.

In the fourth slide, we will learn which market Afterlife is primarily targeting. I choose Europe because this is the platform that is most lacking here, as has already been mentioned in the problems, people sell clothes through Facebook groups and because Europe, such as Paris, is the heart of the fashion industry. Trends that continue to spread to America are mostly emerging in either Europe or Asia.

In the fifth slide, I show the number of people who use Facebook groups, I do not even count Instagram here. This is a fairly high number of 80,000, which is based on active members of these main groups.
