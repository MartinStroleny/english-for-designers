## Main text
Recently, the trend of reselling clothing of large, global brands has grown in the world, and people who create their own pieces of clothing have started selling their products on various platforms. Whether it's mobile applications designed to pre-sell clothes, websites, or just your own websites that serve as an e-shop (for which fashion designers usually pay a lot of money). Thus, there is virtually no product that combines all these possibilities into one platform. Usually, this problem is solved mainly through Facebook or Instagram, where groups are set up for this purpose. Users then sell products directly on the walls, which is not an ideal way for most of them to sell their products. Just because they don't have the opportunity to have the product they sell promoted to people who might theoretically be interested in it.

The aim of this bachelor's thesis is to provide a mobile and web application or service both for the pre-sale of branded clothing and for the sale of original pieces of clothing directly by the designers or large brands themselves, as there is simply no such application that would combine these possibilities. The bachelor's thesis also emphasizes that the application/service comes from Europe and is therefore undermined by several other facts about its origin in Europe.

## Abstract
Mobile and web applications that provide users with the ability to sell and resell branded clothing, help sustainable fashion, and serve fashion designers or brands as a place to target and sell their products.
