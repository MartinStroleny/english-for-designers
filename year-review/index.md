## Year Review

#1. What did you like most about this subject?
The whole subject and structure were conducted in the spirit of the school. I will probably use everything we have learned or had as homework assignments in the future, even if it is only a small part of a great sentence. It was also not only English, but I will also use almost all my knowledge in the Czech language and I use most of the procedures in my own work.

#2. What did you like least about this subject?
I've helped a few students submit on GitHub, it's a great place to learn about Markdown, but in some cases, it's quite restrictive and the student spends a lot of time-fighting GitHub and devoting less time to the content of the tasks. I would like to make more use of Figma and other similar services and applications. Again, it is interesting how they can bypass Markdown and submit tasks differently, but even that can be an indicator of its limits.

#3. What were the top 3 things you learned this year?
I learned better about the voice and tone function and its use in practice. I refreshed my English language and learned from my classmate's different approaches to project presentations.

#4. What was the most memorable activity/assignment from this year?
Beer with my teacher. I didn't even like beer 2 years ago, Prague remarked on me.

#5. What is something you accomplished this year that you are proud of?
I finished my bachelor's thesis, founded a studio and created several successful projects. As a result, I'm so glad I made it all in time. We will see how I turn out in the final exams.

#6. What is one thing you learned about yourself this year?
I learned, even with the help of my bachelor's thesis, that I can't write very well and I have to continue my education and improve it.

#7. What is one thing you would add or change about this class?
I would add a little more grammar, even though I know that I would swear a lot back in the year. Maybe more interaction with students. While this may sound strange, we haven't talked much and rather listened when it wasn't a consultation. I regret this a bit because it is very rewarding for me to have a conversation directly with a person in the field, in which I am professionally engaged.

#8. What is one thing you could have done better this year?
My bachelor's thesis and my irresponsibility significantly disrupted my attendance and assignment. It was rude of me and I'm ashamed of it. Sorry, Justin.

#9. What is one thing I could have done better as a teacher this year?
Try to come up with some assignments, such as classic posters, where the student will be forced to come up with a short catchy sentence in English. The same could apply to claims, such as websites. Pre-create 5 websites and let students add texts that will be missing on the page, perhaps only on the landing page, based on marketing communication. It would be a challenge and perhaps an interesting task, but my professional focus plays a big role here and it would probably not be so beneficial for the rest of the students.

#10. What advice would you give to students going into this subject next year?
Justin is a great teacher, don't be afraid to talk and bring a book here and there. And learn how to work with GitHub.
