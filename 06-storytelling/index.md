## Disclaimer
At school, in the penultimate hour, I presented a short ten-minute video with a tour of the studio and the sleepy Martin, so that it was as true as possible. Unfortunately, I do not want to upload this video to the world wide web, so I created a new shorter description of myself.

## My story
My story started in a small town named Nymburk. I grew up as a shy child who tended to make friends with the biggest misfits. We played a lot outside in nature, or at least as much as possible in Nymburk. And most of all, I enjoyed organizing various games and building bases for future operations. We always made do with what we found outside. 

During the construction of one of the bunkers, I found and used a rusty saw blade which I combined with some rug (for the improved handle) and began to cut through our local forest. When I got home, my parents looked and me and gave me a lesson as to how dangerous rusted metals are. There was a great spanking. But it was worth it, the sense of adventure. And yeah, I was lucky that I haven't scratched myself, but still, what a great adventure and a sense of achievement, I really made a dent in the world and build a small bunker. I loved building stuff and crafting wooden airplanes and boats.

I wish to never lose this sense of adventure. And most of all, I did it with, and for my friends, who could now play there and defend the territory. It felt great and I wished, that in the future, I would work in a team. That I would go on adventures even as an adult. So great right, I was happy kiddo.

And than! Everything went to shit.

My mother took her life, then bullying started (even from my friends, which was weird for me, I just didn't get it), and subsequently, I lost nearly all of my friends. Some of them later started selling drugs, and some took them, a lot of my childhood friends became junkees or gamblers. Fortunately, most of them are on a better path. So I distanced myself from everyone. I was home, alone, playing video games, and trying not to think about the outside world. It was my escape.

This carried on until my final year of school in the Gymnasium when one of my teachers approached me in the school corridors and told me one sentence that really changed my view of my school. I was working on one of my first projects, thanks to which I met Patrik, with whom we subsequently established a software studio. She approached and told me to stop working on something useless and rather focus on school, learning something I knew I would never use in practice. (Good for students who would focus on biology or physics, but not for me)

And yeah, I didn't really care about school, but I especially stopped caring after that moment. In her defense, she was a great teacher, but she only told me to rather let it go and just study more. It shook me and from that moment on I dropped the school out of my head completely and focused mainly on my work as a designer and my studio.

Now I kinda like school but I am scared of my final exams.
