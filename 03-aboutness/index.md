## My Story

My goal is to connect people with brands and companies through design, a combination of strong concepts and refined execution.

In 2021 I co-founded the software company Apparently s.r.o., where I currently work as a multidisciplinary designer. I'm always available for interesting collaborations and fun side projects. If you would like to cooperate, do not hesitate to contact me.

I am currently studying the final year of my bachelor's degree at University of Creative Communication with a specialization in Graphic and Media design.
