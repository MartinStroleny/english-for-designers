## My Story

![Martin Strolený sitting on a old chair staring out of focus.](img/martin-stroleny.jpg)

My goal is to connect people with brands and companies through design, a combination of strong concepts and refined execution.

I co-founded the software company Apparently Studio, where I currently work as a multidisciplinary designer. I'm always available for interesting collaborations and fun side projects. If you would like to cooperate, do not hesitate to contact me.

I am currently studying the final year of my bachelor's degree at University of Creative Communication in the field of Graphic and Media design.
