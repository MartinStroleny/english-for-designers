## My Story

![Martin Strolený sitting on a old chair staring out of focus.](img/martin-stroleny.jpg)

My goal is to connect people with brands and companies through design, a combination of strong concepts and refined execution.

I co-founded the software company Apparently Studio, where I currently work as a multidisciplinary designer. I'm always available for interesting collaborations and fun side projects. If you would like to cooperate, do not hesitate to contact me.

In addition to all this, I am also studying at the University of Creative Communication in Prague, focusing on graphic and media design, where I will pass a bachelor's exam this year.
