#### Takeaways
1. Substance over form. I should start with content, than add design elements which support it and give it more meaning and memorability.
2. Importance and application of voice, tone and style in design systems.
3. Thinking about how I communicate my thoughts, ideas and projects in both everyday and professional life.
4. Awareness of mistakes in my speeches, presentations and in the communication of my projects in front of strangers, where I am afraid of every word and my own failure. I have to learn to trust myself. This applies to both my native and English language.
5. It is possible to have a nice time in english lessons. Thank you Justin.
