## Takeaways
#### Substance over form
I should start with content, than add design elements which support it and give it more meaning and memorability.
#### Accessibility
Seek more accessibility in the way I design software solutions.
#### Voice, Tone and Style
Meaning and application of voice, tone and style in design systems. After the lesson I learned about this, I immediately used it in practice.
#### Commication skills
Thinking about how I communicate my thoughts, ideas and projects in both everyday and professional life.
#### Recognizing my mistakes
Awareness of mistakes in my speeches, presentations and in the overall communication of my projects in front of strangers, where I am afraid of every word and my own failure. I have to learn to trust my communication skills and constantly improve them. This applies to both my native and English language.
#### Thank you
It is possible to have a nice time in english lessons. Thank you Justin.
