1. Substance over form. I should start with content, than add design elements which support it and give it more meaning and memorability.
2. Importance and application of voice, tone and style in design systems.
3. Thinking about how i use my language in daily life and in professional enviroment.
4. Recognizing my mistakes in speeches and presentations, overall how i communicate my ideas and projects.
5. It is possible to have a nice time in english lessons. Thank you Justin.
