## Takeaways
1. Substance over form. I should start with content, than add design elements which support it and give it more meaning and memorability.
2. Seek more accessibility in the way I design software solutions.
3. Meaning and application of voice, tone and style in design systems. After the lesson I learned about this, I immediately used it in practice.
4. Thinking about how I communicate my thoughts, ideas and projects in both everyday and professional life.
5. Awareness of mistakes in my speeches, presentations and in the overall communication of my projects in front of strangers, where I am afraid of every word and my own failure. I have to learn to trust my communication skills and constantly improve them. This applies to both my native and English language.
6. It is possible to have a nice time in english lessons. Thank you Justin.
